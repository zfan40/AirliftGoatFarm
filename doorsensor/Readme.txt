this is the code for two pin magnetic switch.
the front pin connect to power, can work under either 3v or 5v.
this code define the sensor pin as 2, so connect the back pin to Digital Pin 2.
The sensor is probably not stable during "switch open" state, the code adds filtering to it at a meaningful rate that is friendly to normal musical interactions.
