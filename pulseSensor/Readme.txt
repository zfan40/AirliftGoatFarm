this is the pulse sensor Amped bought from adafruit.
The scripts are minimized from the library from Joel Murphy and Yury Gitman.
via this script, you are supposed to connect black cable to GND, red cable to 5v and purple cable to A0 ANALOG IN.
pin 13 will have HIGH voltage, and serial print 1. That can be either received by some software or for other purposes.
